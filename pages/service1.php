Banks today are the most victimized source of attacks and often complain of fraudulent activities taking place in their systems. Identity theft and Impersonation are the common attacks by which money is being swindled and transferred into unwarranted and unidentified accounts. Proxy servers and IP’s are used to do such type of attacks so that then actual culprit goes free and innocent victims are targeted. At IQSS we have proven techniques to catch the perpetrator of a banking fraud no matter how complex technology has been used to break into the systems. We follow reverse engineering techniques and IP tracking with the sophisticated tools and techniques to reach the perpetrator.
